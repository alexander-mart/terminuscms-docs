# terminuscms-docs
A place for us to build brilliant TerminusCMS documentation.

Wowza, you're all here, nice to meet so many likeminded people.

This is a place where we are going to build the TerminusCMS documentation.

Save your md files in this repo so we can all review and see what we've got. We'll dogfood our docs using these files.

Here are some instructions for the Reference Guides that you've been assigned. **Please complete these by 3rd March**

[Expanded docs structure](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xh4kkZu5uD2r-x8HgqrmHCsZBaVB6dngf9FTSsUyYlc/edit?usp=sharing) *might need some fine tuning.*
