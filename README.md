# TerminusCMS Docs To Do...
*A place for us to build brilliant TerminusCMS documentation.*

Stage 1 - Write the documenation.

**Deadline: 3rd March**

*PRIORITY - How-to guides*

Edit the placeholder md files in this repo. Copy whatever is relevant from TerminusDB docs. To see what docs job has your name on, refer to this document: [Expanded docs structure](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xh4kkZu5uD2r-x8HgqrmHCsZBaVB6dngf9FTSsUyYlc/edit?usp=sharing). When you've done one, check it off in the Google doc so we can see what's still left to do.

*THEN - We need to update the reference guides*

For who's got to do what, and some helpful notes, please refer to the [Reference guide instructions and respnsibilities document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WlYkf0gRAIg-AVZPlgaXm0JW_WgMytl4bVgmvexWDc4/edit?usp=sharing)
