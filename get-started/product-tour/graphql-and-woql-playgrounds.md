# GraphQL & WOQL Playgrounds

*An overview of the GraphQL and WOQL playgrounds in the TerminusCMS dashboard*

TerminusCMS features a query playground for [GraphQL](../../how-to/query/graphql/query-basics.md) and [WOQL](../../how-to/query/woql/woql-basics.md).

### GraphQL Playground

TerminusCMS includes GraphiQL to experiment and test queries. It automatically generates the GraphQL schema based on the project's schema.&#x20;

It includes -

* List of root types within the project
* Autofill to aid query construction
* Pretty print
* Results panel
* Error reporting

For more details about the types of queries available with GraphQL, such as path queries, filters, and arguments, please refer to the [GraphQL reference guide](../../reference-guides/graphql-reference).

### WOQL Playground

Web Object Query Language (WOQL) is a powerful and sophisticated query language which allows you to concisely express complex patterns over arbitrary data structures.&#x20;

The playground enables users to build WOQL queries to experiment and test. Users can also -

* View query as JSON-LD format
* Copy the query
* See results
* Select query parameters based on the schema (left side of the screen)

Please see these other resources for understanding and using WOQL -

* [WOQL Basics](../../how-to/query/woql/woql-basics.md)
* [WOQL reference guide](../../reference-guides/woql.md)
