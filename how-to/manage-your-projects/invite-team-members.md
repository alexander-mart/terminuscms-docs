2. Select 'Team Members'.
3. In the following screen, select 'Invite a Member'.

4. In the pop-up window, enter the user’s email address and select one of the following access permissions - _this will be applied to team-level permissions so will apply to all data products within your team. If you want to only give read-write access to a specific data product, it makes sense to give the user low-level permissions and assign higher permissions for that data product only - we will explain this next_.&#x20;
   * Admin - can add and remove users and permissions and has total access to data products.&#x20;
   * Collaborator - Able to access data products.&#x20;
   * Data Updater - Read and write access to data products.&#x20;
   * Data Reader - Read-only access to data products. Info Reader -&#x20;
   * Schema-level access but not data-level access.&#x20;
5. The user will be sent an email with a link they need to click (if they don’t receive it, tell them to check their spam folder).&#x20;
6. When the user has accepted the invitation, their details will display within the Team Members section.

### **Editing & Removing Users**

To edit the role given to a user:

1. Navigate to the Team Members section from the profile dropdown.
2. Find the user to change from the list and click on the second icon.&#x20;
3. From the pop-up window, select the new role to give them.

To delete a user from a team, do the same as above, but select the third icon in red.

> Hover over the icons for information about what they do.

### **Granular Permissions**

Grant different permissions for different data products/projects. To do this do the following:

1. Navigate to the Team Members section from the profile dropdown.&#x20;
2. Find the user to add specific data product permissions for and click on the first icon.&#x20;
3. The resulting table below will list all of the data products in the team.&#x20;
4. Choose the data product to change the user’s role for by clicking on the edit permissions icon.&#x20;
5. Choose from the list of permissions

> Users can only have permissions higher than the team permissions, so if someone needs read/write permissions for only one data product, ensure that the team permissions are set at a lower level.
