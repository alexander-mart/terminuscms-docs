Once you have cloned the database, go to the GraphQL icon (triangle in
hexagon) on the left hand side and select the filing cabinet icon.

Now you can will have two panels, one on the left for query, and one
on the right for results.

## Entering a query

First type `query{ ` into the query panel. It should look like this:

```graphql
query{
   â–ˆ
}
```

If at cursor point you type: `Ctrl-c` you'll get the list of options
you can choose from. These options are legal GraphQL syntax according
to your provided schema.  Let's search for people from the Star Wars
universe.

```graphql
query{
   People{
      label
   }
}
```

The `label` property in this schema, supplies the name of the person
we are interested in. Of course this query might give us a bit too
much, so let us also limit it.

```graphql
query{
   People(limit: 5){
      label
   }
}
```

This should result in:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "People": [
      {
        "label": "Luke Skywalker"
      },
      {
        "label": "Obi-Wan Kenobi"
      },
      {
        "label": "Anakin Skywalker"
      },
      {
        "label": "Wilhuff Tarkin"
      },
      {
        "label": "Chewbacca"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

To get more fields in our query, we can just add words, using `Ctrl-c`
if we are stuck for names of fields.

```graphql
query{
   People(limit: 5){
      label
   }
}
```

When following links to other objects, we have to embed a query inside
our query. So, for instance, if we want to know the homeworld that
each of these people come from we can write:

```graphql
query{
   People(limit: 2){
      label
      homeworld{
        label
      }
   }
}
```

This will get us: 

```json
{
  "data": {
    "People": [
      {
        "label": "Luke Skywalker",
        "homeworld": {
          "label": "Tatooine"
        }
      },
      {
        "label": "Obi-Wan Kenobi",
        "homeworld": {
          "label": "Stewjon"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Paging

If we want to page the results, we can also add an offset to our
query, and we'll get *the next* results.

```graphql
query{
   People(limit: 2, offset:2){
      label
      homeworld{
        label
      }
   }
}
```

And now we get two more:

```graphql
{
  "data": {
    "People": [
      {
        "label": "Anakin Skywalker",
        "homeworld": {
          "label": "Tatooine"
        }
      },
      {
        "label": "Wilhuff Tarkin",
        "homeworld": {
          "label": "Eriadu"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
