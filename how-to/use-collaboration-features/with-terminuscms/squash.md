# Squash a branch or main for a project with the TerminusCMS dashboard

*Squash the commits of a branch or main into one large commit using the TerminusCMS dashboard.*

To squash a branch of a database, or indeed main, navigate to the project home page, the first icon on left that looks like a databasse.

Scroll down to the `Manage Branches` section and selected `Branches`.

Next to the branch you want to squash, select the ellipses symbol to see the branch options.
